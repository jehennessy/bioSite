            <p id="intro"> Gripping the throttle, knuckles turning white with desire. The wheels of the liter bike exploding on the racetrack like a shot from a Barrett 50 cal. Heart beating out of your chest,  enhances your experience of life. It has to be the closest thing to time travel, you’re moving and everyone else is standing still. That’s what racing a bike feels like. </p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
              
              <p> To me riding is not just a hobby, its a lifestyle. Riding bikes has brought amazing stories, people, and places into my life. With over 40 years of experience riding, starting off with racing dirt bikes as a youngster, I want to take it to a new level. At 55 years young I want to reinvent myself. I want to race in the super-sport category at racetracks across America. I have many experiences in my life but being on a bike is the most humbling thing, it reminds me I'm human, it gives me energy, and it fills my life with purpose. </p>
              
            <h2> Wounded Warrior Project </h2>
              
              <p> I currently have the opportunity to take my dreams into full action. BMW has given me the offer to join their school of racing. This training will give me a racing license that I will be able to utilize in the race for the Wounded Warrior Project. If you have the means to help me in my cause and would like to help support my project, you can strengthen my fight on my <a href="" id="fund-link" target="_blank" title="Go to Rick's Go Fund Me page" > Go Fund Me</a> page. </p>
