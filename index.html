          <h1>Meet <br /> Rick</h1>
            
            <p id="intro">Just imagine, you’re working undercover for the DEA. A tip just came in about a crack dealer. It’s your job to catch them in the act. Your orders are to go in wired and get them to sell to you. You pull up to the house, the dealer comes to your car. You ask for the 7 grams and she goes back into the house to get it. As you’re waiting, the microphone strapped to your back starts to overheat, it’s extremely painful. But, there’s gangs right outside the car and you don’t want to draw any attention, so you got to keep your cool. This is just one of the many adrenaline rushing stories in the crazy world of Rick. </p>

            <h2>From Outlaw to Going Undercover</h2>
              
              <p>In Kansas City, Rick had a diesel fuel theft ring, with a team of guys that would go around and steal fuel, making $1500 a night. He ended up getting a charge in Omaha. OPD was like “Hey man, we know what you’re doing, why don’t you just come work for us.” He did just that for 10 years working on different projects with the DEA, FBI, ATF and USPS, from everything to guns, drugs and prostitution. </p>
              
            <h2> Love of Motorcycles </h2>
              
              <p> He started to get into dirt biking at a young age, which led to his love of motorcycle racing.  Now he’s unstoppable, with the fastest bike in Omaha “The Boogyman.” It’s a family tradition, his father was a motorcycle policeman and his sons have grown up riding bikes. Rick’s grandson Liam is only 5 and can’t wait to learn how to ride. </p>
              
              <p> It’s more than just the freedom of riding that Rick likes. It’s the community he’s been able to build with the bond of the love for riding. It’s one of the things that has really helped him get through his most recent divorce, getting to meet new people who are there to support him. </p>
